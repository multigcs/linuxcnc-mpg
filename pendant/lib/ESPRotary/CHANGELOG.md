# Changelog

## Unreleased

- none

**Note**: Unreleased changes are checked in but not part of an official release (available through the Arduino IDE or PlatfomIO) yet. This allows you to test WiP features and give feedback to them.

## [2.1.1] - 2023-04-27

- fixed bug in `setIncrement()` as pointed out by WJurasek-KV
- updated `SimpleCounter.ino` example

## [2.1.0] - 2023-04-13

- updated enums with class feature
- Added `triggerOnBounds(bool triggerEvents = true)` method to be able to suppress rotate events when the boundaries are reached
- Made `now` and time related attributes to `unsigned long`
- Replaced cases with lookup table to simplify `loop()`
- Simplified state change in the `loop()`
- Positions are only set within the defined boundaries
- some refactoring suggested by GPT-4

Most changes were suggested in [#43](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/ESPRotary/pull/43) by [Alex Herman](https://github.com/gaaf). Thank you.

## [2.0.0] - 2022-12-27

- added speedup functionality as suggested in [#37](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/ESPRotary/discussions/37)

  ```c++
  void setSpeedupInterval(int time);
  void setSpeedupIncrement(int inc);
  void enableSpeedup(bool enable);
  
  bool isSpeedupEnabled() const;
  int getSpeedupInterval() const;
  int getSpeedupIncrement() const;

  void setSpeedupStartedHandler(CallbackFunction f);
  void setSpeedupEndedHandler(CallbackFunction f);
  bool isInSpeedup() const;
  ```
